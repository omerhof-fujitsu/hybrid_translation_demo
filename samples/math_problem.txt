# Sample Math Problem

In a triangle ABC, the points D, E, and F are the midpoints of sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. Prove that:

$\vec{AD} + \vec{BE} + \vec{CF} = \vec{0}$

Additionally, use the midpoint formula to show that the centroid G of the triangle divides each median in the ratio $2:1$.

## Part 2

Consider a parallelogram with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(a,0)$, $(b,c)$, and $(a+b,c)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive real numbers.

1. Calculate the area of the parallelogram.
2. Find the coordinates of the intersection point of the diagonals.
3. If $a=3$, $b=2$, and $c=4$, calculate the perimeter of the parallelogram.

## Part 3

The normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ has probability density function:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Explain why the standard normal distribution (where $\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$) is important in statistics.
