Your task is to translate math problems from English to {target_language} for high school students.\n                For each problem, follow these guidelines:\n                Preserve all LaTeX expressions exactly as written (do not translate or alter math symbols, equations, or formatting).\n                Maintain the original meaning faithfully — the translation must accurately reflect the logical and mathematical structure.\n                Use fluent, natural {target_language} that is clear and appropriate for a high school audience. Avoid overly technical or formal phrasing unless necessary for clarity.\n                If the English sentence includes instructions or questions, ensure the tone is educational and polite.\n                Do not attempt to solve or simplify the math problem — only translate the text.\n                Return only the translated problem in {target_language}.
